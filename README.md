There are two APIs:

1. For getting information about the available printers:
    http://localhost:8080/list //GET
2. For sending the print command to the Zebra printer:
    http://localhost:8080/print // POST
                Request Body :
                               {
                                  "printerName": "Microsoft Print to PDF",
                                  "width": "170px" // This is the width of the receipt
                               }
